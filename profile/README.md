# Exchron

**Exchron** is a student-led initiative based in Sri Lanka, created by a group of high school students passionate about space science and artificial intelligence. It is a one-of-a-kind resource network designed to make **exoplanet science and machine learning** accessible to students, researchers, and enthusiasts alike.

Through Exchron, users can **learn about exoplanets**, **analyze real NASA data**, and **build or train machine learning models** to classify exoplanets—all through an integrated web platform.
